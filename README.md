## Getting Started with Unity

### Prerequisites
- Unity Hub installed ([Download here](https://unity.com/download))
- Unity Editor version **2022.3.43f1** (required)
  - You can install this version through Unity Hub → Installs → Install Editor → Archive → download specific version

### Opening the Project

1. **Clone or download this repository**
```bash
   git clone [YOUR-REPO-URL]
```

2. **Install the correct Unity version**
   - Open Unity Hub
   - Go to "Installs" tab
   - Click "Install Editor" → "Archive"
   - Find and install **Unity 2022.3.43f1**
   - (Alternative: Use this direct archive link: https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive)

3. **Add the project to Unity Hub**
   - Go to the "Projects" tab
   - Click the "Add" button (or "Open" in newer versions)
   - Navigate to the downloaded repository folder
   - Select the `VGDC-2025-Game-Jam-Officer-Game` folder (this is the Unity project root)
   - Click "Open" or "Add Project"

4. **Open the project**
   - The project should now appear in your Unity Hub projects list
   - Click on the project to open it in Unity Editor
   - Unity Hub should automatically use version 2022.3.43f1

5. **Wait for Unity to import assets**
   - The first time you open the project, Unity will need to import all assets
   - This can take several minutes depending on project size

### Troubleshooting
- **Wrong Unity version?** The project requires exactly version 2022.3.43f1. Using a different version may cause compatibility issues or errors.
- **Project won't open?** Make sure you're selecting the `VGDC-2025-Game-Jam-Officer-Game` folder, not the root repository folder
